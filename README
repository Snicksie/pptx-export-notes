pptx-export-notes

v1
by Eric Jang

a simple script to extract the presenter notes from a .pptx file and export them into a single rtf file (for printing/rehearsing).

Usage:

pptx_export_speaker_notes.py -p /Users/Eric/Desktop/myppt.pptx

A .txt file containing all of the presenter notes will be exported to the same directory as the .pptx file.

This only works for .pptx files as they use Microsoft's OpenXML format (will not work for ppt files).
